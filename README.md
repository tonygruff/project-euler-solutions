# project-euler-solutions
Repo for my Project Euler solutions. Considered a portfolio to demonstrate coding and problem solving skills.

This repository is simply a place to (publicly) store my coding solutions for "Project Euler" (https://projecteuler.net/about) problems that I have completed. I mostly use R/R Studio but sometimes use SageMathCell (https://sagecell.sagemath.org/). It should go without mention, but for completeness I want to explicitly warn any PE participants that this repo is entirely composed of spoilers for the problems I have committed.

A number of these may be rewritten as I learn improvements.
